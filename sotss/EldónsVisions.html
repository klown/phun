        <p>These are notes about Eldo&#769;n's visions.  Some of the information within a note are there to establish the context of the vision, including when and where it occurred, and things that were happening with other PCs at the same time.  The context information is styled according to whether it is information from the DM, a quote from something that happened in the session, or a vision.</p>

      <h4 class="headingAndDate">Session 1 Room Two</h4>
      <p class="date">(01-Jun-2013)</p>
      <p>During session one while in the Godsmouth Ossuary, some time before Eldo&#769;n's actual vision, the party encountered a strange statue:
      </p>
      <p id="feather1">You see a statue of a feather emblazoned with a large open eye.  Although apparently carved from stone, the statue gleams with a golden-green iridescence.  Lady Anthea identifies the statue as representing the Peacock Spirit, whose worship ended with Thassilon’s fall (Knowledge check).</p>
      <p>Carved into the floor between the feather statue and the doors into the room:</p>
      <blockquote>"Though veiled behind the plummage of the soul, the eyes still see unblinking through all the ages from the beginning to the end of time.  When the three are one, and the spirit becomes flesh, the seal may be opened, and the sleeper awakened, and the glorious apocalypse shall consume us all."</blockquote>
      <p id="hawthorneVision" class="vision">Hawthorne has a vision of a smiling (friendly) man in robes (a priest?) with peacock feathers on the robe.

      <p>Later, during session four, the party entered the "cathedral room", a circular room containing eight statues.  Seven of the statues were of the rune lords.  The eighth statute was of Pharasma.
      </p>
      <p>Midnight flew to one particular statue in the cathedral room, and hovered near it.  Eldo&#769;n approached the statue &hellip;</p>

        <h5>Vision #1</h5>
        <p>I recognize the runelord depicted by the statue.  I "hear", "This is the one that is responsible", and have a fleeting impression of being trapped in a prison without doors.</p>
        <p>I assume that this is a message from Midnight communicated to me telephathically.</p>
        <p>The runelord is Karzoug, Runelord of Pride.</p>

      <h3>Vision #2</h3>
      <h4 class="headingAndDate">Session 8</h4>
      <p class="date">(01-Dec-2013)</p>
      <p>The session was where the party was fighting Natalya and her cronies in a ramshackle "house" in the Underbridge.  Eldo&#769;n had climbed up to a wooden platform built into the large chimney to retrieve some sleep arrows that had missed their target.  Below him, Sir Lee was inspecting the now prone Natalya and found a shard.  As he touched the shard, Eldo&#769;n went into a trance &hellip;

        <h4>Vision #2</h4>
        <p>I am in Kaer Maega, going about my business, but I know that I am not free to leave the city.</p>
        <p>I'm inside one of the walled sections of the city, and come to a shrine containing a statue of a single, radiant peacock feather.  The  feather appears both fluid and solid.  I am transfixed by the feather.  The feather gives me a sense of liberation and redemption, and represents a sense of nobility, majesty, and justice.</p>
        <p>There is also a sense of promise of retribution for what <em>they</em> did to my father.
        </p>
        <p>The style of clothing of the people in the vicinity is unfamiliar and definitely not contemporary, but I am uncertain if it is of the past, present, or future.
        </p>
        <p>Upon reflection, I do not think this vision is coming directly from Midnight, but is somehow related to her, nonetheless.  I recall that there was a <a href="#feather1">statue of a peacock feather in the Godsmouth Ossuary</a>.</p>

      <h3>Vision #3</h3>
      <h4 class="headingAndDate">Session 19</h4>
      <p class="date">(17-Jan-2015)</p>
      <p>The party found the next shard within the Crow.  During our exploration of the Crow, we came to a seven-sided shrine and saw a shard made of adamantine, likely the Shard of Greed.  Lady Anthea placed the ioun stone into the shard, and Hawthorne took it.  One of his tatoos resolved into the Thassilonian Rune of Generosity.  At the same time, Eldo&#769;n went into a trance &hellip;
      <section id="vision3" class="vision">
        <h5>Vision #3</h5>
        <p>I am shackled and led into Kaer Maga’s subterranean depths. After an indeterminate time, I arrive at a massive underground prison. Walking past cells, I hear screams, maniacal laughter and lost cries.</p>
        <p>I am taken down a long corridor. To either side are circular portals framed in starmetal. I can’t see through the transparent portals, but the reflections of the illuminated blue or green fluids within play across the ceiling of the corridor.</p>
        <p>My cell is at the very end of the corridor. The vampire guards turn the wheel, unlocking a spherical chamber.</p>
        <p>I do not resist being placed into the reclining metal seat, or the wand-like devices that inject themselves into my torso and head. Glowing fluid flows about me as the door closes and locks. And while the magic attempts to torment me with false memories of what could have been, instead I am protected, enveloped by the comfort of a peacock feather. </p>

      <h3>Vision #4</h3>
      <h4 class="headingAndDate">Session 34</h4>
      <p class="date">(30-Oct-2016)</p>
      <p>The party was inside the huge statue/lighthouse known as the Lady of the Light.  After defeating the false Sorshen, we went through a teleport gate and ended up in a shrine &ndash; a room of sweaty pink walls, dry clay floor, sparkling flecks in the air, and the sound of heavy breathing.  We found a triangular shard of red metal: the Shard of Lust resting alone on a shelf. Hawthorne used mage hands to move the ioun stone into the round depression on the shard and one of his tattoos resolved into the Shard of Love.  Eldo&#769;n's eyes glazed over for a second or two &hellip;
      <section id="vision4" class="vision">
        <h5>Vision #4</h5>
        <p>Only myself and three Shoanti remain standing.</p>
        <p>The battle had been hard fought, but now we stood atop the Great Pinnacle of Kaer Maga, the vampire Governor Redjein defeated &ndash; brought down in the end by the divine power of the Sky Whisperer.
        </p>
        <p>Two of her clansmen had perished in the battle.  I had rescued Sky Whisperer shortly after my own awakening in the fluid chamber, the eldritch machinations dormant about me.
        </p>
        <p>Who knows how long I had been suspended in that metallic orb, and for what purpose my life energy (and that of my fellow captives) had been channeled to accompish.  However, as we fought our way up the stairways and landings of the Pinnacle, the protraits and statuary revealed a new Runelord &ndash; a different Runelord &ndash; than the one who led Shalast at the time of my imprisonment.
        </p>
        <p>I warned Sky Whisperer to be cautious.  What we spent so much time to achieve was presented in front of us, mounted on the wall behind the Governor's desk.  A small stone was attached, and I nodded &ndash; giving her my blessing to approach and take the shard.
        </p>
        <p>The Peacock Spirit had led us here.  Soon a new future would emerge from what remained.  My role had only just begun in securing that future &ndash; and righting the wrongs of the past.
